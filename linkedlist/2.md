# Add Two numbers 

given two linked lists add the numbers (the list is given in reverse order so that the last digit appears first)

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        dummy = ListNode() # set up initial list
        ans = dummy

        total = 0 # sum 
        carry = 0 

        while l1 or l2 or carry:

            total = carry # start with the previous carry value for this total we will calc

            '''
            For both pointers we will sum up what they point to in addition to the carry
            that we just added. This accounts for any previous carries that we may have had
            in addition to the current sum we are doing, and if one of the list has already 
            been exhausted then we can use the other one without issue
            '''
            if l1: 
                total += l1.val
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                total += l2.val
                l2 = l2.next

            '''
            num -> this is the value that we will actaully put onto the list, since we can 
            % 10 this value this means that whatever we insert will always be less than 10

            carry -> we need to divide (integer division) the current sum (total) in order
            to determine what the carry is since // 10 just gives us the next digit in the
            number we then know if we need to make a carry or not
            '''
            num = total % 10 
            carry = total // 10

            # now append to the answer list
            dummy.next = ListNode(val=num)
            dummy = dummy.next

        return ans.next # return answer pointer
            
```
Time: O(N) Since we need to visit every number in both lists<br>
Space: O(N) This will be the final list that we return which can either be >= the length of the longest list that was given as input<br>

Notes: This question is pretty easy BUT only if u recognize how to take care of the carry else this becomes very difficult. This was a solution posted that I used but pretty much we can use % 10 to get the actual summed value and then use // 10 to take care of the carry.
