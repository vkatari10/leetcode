# Set Matrix Zeros

Given an array set the columns and rows where "0" appears to all zeros.<br>

Status: Completed brute force solution.<br>

Code:<br>

```
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """

        row_len = len(matrix[0])
        nil_row = [0] * row_len
      
        rows = []
        cols = []

        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[0])):

                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                     rows.append(i)
                     cols.append(j)

        for i in range(len(rows)):
            matrix[rows[i]] = nil_row

        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[0])):

                if j in cols:
                    matrix[i][j] = 0
```
This solution can be optimized to use the matrix itself and its first row and first column to store flags to mark the rows and columns that need to be set to zero rather than just using extra spce to store the `rows` and `cols` array like I did.
