# Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST

Given a BST and two nodes p, q find their least common ancestor. Note that a node's LCA can be itself.

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        

        cur = root # let it be the root


        while cur: # while the current pointer is not null 

            if cur.val > p.val and cur.val > q.val:
                # if the current value of the pointer is greater than the value of 
                # both p and q then we know that we need to go check the left subtree
                # since only both nodes can be available on that side given the ordering
                # property of the BST
                cur = cur.left
            elif cur.val < p.val and cur.val < q.val:
                # and we would do the oppositeub if we find that p and q are larger than 
                # the value of the current pointer
                cur = cur.right
            else:
                # if we find something that is either equal to p or q then we can just return 
                # that node itself
                return cur
```
Time: O(logn) We cut the tree down in half everytime we move<br>
Space: O(1)<br>

Notes: We can exploit the BST ordering property in order to come up with this solution since we know if a number is too large or too small then we know that we only need to check that side of the tree, and if we cannot do either then we just return the current node.
