# Pascals Traingle

Find the entire triangle of Pascals triangle up to a given row. 

```
class Solution:
    def generate(self, numRows: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        ans = [[1]] # base case array

        for i in range(numRows - 1):  # since we did the base case we do NumRows - 1
            '''
            The trick to this problem is that we can put 0's at the front and end
            of the array since they are implied to get the 1's at the beg and end
            of each row, this makes adding each value in the row far easier
            '''
            temp = [0] + ans[-1] + [0] 
            new_row = [] # this is the new row we will construct on this iteration
            '''
            Now each new row is going to be the legnth of the row above it + 1
            so we want to make sure that we account for this in the for loop termination
            condition. 

            We can use two pointers to add up sets of each number to construct this new 
            row which will eventully give us the final addition of all the numbers in this 
            row
            '''
            for j in range(len(ans[-1]) + 1):
                new_row.append(temp[j] + temp[j + 1])

            ans.append(new_row) # append to the original answer array
        
        return ans
```
Time: O(N^2) Since we need to visit every row and then sum up against each row<br>
Space: O(N) Since we need to store and return the result, as well as the temp row arrays<br>

Notes: This is very much a DP problem where we need to use the last result (or row in this case) to help construct the new row, this is somewhat similar to the level order traversal of trees where need to process each row at a time, but we are dependent on the previous rows that came before. This problem also involved a trick where we needed to append 0's to the beg and end of the array to make the addition of numbers easier.
