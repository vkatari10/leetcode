# Merge Two Sorted Lists

Given the head of two sorted linked list combine them into a single one and return 

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        dummy = ListNode()
        curr = dummy

        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val > list2.val:
                curr.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            else:
                curr.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            curr = curr.next 
        
        if list1:
            curr.next = list1
        else: 
            curr.next = list2
        
        return dummy.next

        
```
Time: O(n) We need to copy every node from both lists<br>
Space: O(1)/O(N) If we consider the new list to be extra space than O(N), else O(1)<br>

Notes: This is pretty simple but note how we use a dummy node to start of the list and return the dummy.next rather than just starting from something that was `None`.
