# Copy List with random pointer

Given a linked list that also includes a random pointer to another item in the list or null make a deep copy of it.

        This works because the entire relationship is established in the first while
        loop and then we can start the second while loop so that we can map all the nodes
        to each other like we did in the second while loop since we now have a hash map 
        that links ot both the next and random pointers

```
Time: O(N) We need to store every node once and then rewire the node copies on the second pass<br>
Space: O(N) To store the nodes in the hash map<br>

Notes: The trick here is that the Keys in the hash map that we use are actually just nodes as long as the dictionary at the start is declared as `{None:None}` then we can just shove objects in the there and then manipulate the copies due to the fact that we stores the nodes as original:copies. After knowing that this problem becomes very easy
