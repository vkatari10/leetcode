# Redundant Connection 

This problem wants us to find the nodes that form a edge that cause a cycle in a tree.


```Python
class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:

        '''
        This is the most basic union find question 

        All we are doing is for every two nodes we are going to check if their parents
        (the find algo) ends up going back to the same origin node and if so then we know 
        that this edge set is the thing causing a cycle. 

        We CANNOT use Kahns algo here because this graph is undirected so we need to use 
        Disjoint Set Union 

        Honestly you can just memorize the union and find methods because DSU is usually the 
        same the only thing you might need to change is the parent set at the top and 
        the logic at the bottom 
        '''
        
        '''
        This is just going to be a list of every node in the set 

        Note that index 0 is not used since the nodes are labeled from 1->n as the problem 
        states
        '''
        parent = [i for i in range(len(edges) + 1)]


        
        def find(x):
            '''
            All you need to know here is that this is finding the parent node of
            a given node x 
            '''
            while parent[x] != x:
                '''
                Compress the path because it improves runtime / search speed
                '''
                parent[x] = parent[parent[x]] # this just compresses the path over time

                x = parent[x]
            return x

        def union(x, y):
            '''
            Ok this is more simple all we are doing here is that if
            some node x and node y end up going to back the the parent node
            then this mean that these x and y cause a cycle -> return false

            return false bceause once we detect a cycle it is no longer aclyclic, 
            of course change this based on the problem 

            else pretty much we are going to set the parent of y to x after idk why
            but just know that and return true since this did not lead to a cycle 
            '''
            rootX = find(x)
            rootY = find(y)
            if rootX == rootY:
                return False
            parent[rootY] = rootX 
            return True

        '''
        This is specific to this problem where we just wanna check every edge pair 
        and then like if the union method finds that both nodes cause a cycle just return 
        that set since they are going to make the graph cyclic

        Since this problem just adds one cycle edge then we just return that 
        '''
        for u, v in edges:
            if not union(u, v):
                return [u, v]


        # for further optimization you would use union with rank but its overkill for this 
        # problem
```
Time: O(N) Since we need to check every node<br>
Space: O(N) Since we need to store every node in the list at the beginning<br>

Notes: We use DSU here since the graph is not directed else we could have just used Kahn. For the most part the find and union methods can just be copied and pasted along with the parent list according to the problem and then just change the final logic according to the problem.
