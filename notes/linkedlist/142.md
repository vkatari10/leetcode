# Linked List Cycle II

Determine if there is a cycle in the linked list

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

        We will use Floyd's algo which helps us determine if there is a cycle
        or not in a linked structures. 

        Pretty much all we need to do is 
        1. Determine if there is a cycle, if not return None
        2. If there is a cycle find the node that makes up the cycle
        '''
        slow = fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            '''
            Two things will happen here

            1. If there is actually no cycle then fast will just hit None and the
            if statement will be executed
            2. There will be a cycle and the loop will break (since slow and fast will 
            hit each other again) and will not enter the loop statement
            '''
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

            if slow == fast: # if there is a cycle
                break
        else: # if there is no cycle
            return None
        

        '''
        At this point this means the linked list has a cycle so now we need
        to determine which node actually is the cyclical node

        Just reset fast back to the head (it doesn't really matter where we put fast)
        and just keep looping until they are equal and return one of the nodes as the 
        problem asks
        '''
        fast = head 
        while fast != slow:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next

        return slow
```
Time: O(n + m) Since we need to walk both lists<br>
Space: O(1) We just need two pointers<br>

Notes: This problem can also be solved with a set and just tracking the nodes we have visited but the one above is oprtimal since no extra space is needed
