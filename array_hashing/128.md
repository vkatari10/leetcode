# Longest Consecutive Sequence

Find the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array of integers.

```
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        longest = 0
        num_set = set(nums) # we need to conver the list into a set for O(1) lookup
        ans = 0

        for number in num_set: # now we will check every number from the number set
            
            '''
            This is just saying like if we find that there is a number 1 less
            than the current one in the set then we should not check if it is
            the longest subseqeunce because we already know that this number is
            already part of another one

            You will hit TLE if you forget this since we will end up checking every 
            possible number making it horribly inefficient
            '''
            if number - 1 not in num_set: # important optimization

                temp = number
                while temp in num_set: # just keep adding one to check sequence
                    temp += 1
                    longest += 1
                
                ans = max(ans, longest)
                longest = 0

        return ans
```
Time: O(N) Since we need to check every number in the array<br>
Space: O(N) Since we need to store the entire nums array into a set<br>

Notes: Pretty much we need to convert the list into a set because we need to ensure that we can have O(1) lookups instead of looking at the input array. This is a pretty simple solution given the problem and is self explanatory but the if statement insdie the loop is very important so we don't end up checking unecessary numbers.
