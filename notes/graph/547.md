# Number of Provinces

There are n cities in an adjancey matrix, if they have an edge together than they count as a collective as one province. Find the number of provinces. 

```

    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(isConnected)
        provinces = 0
        '''
        Below we construct an empty adjanceny list that will convert the input
        adjancency. This will make it easier to run dfs on the input grid.

        Pretty much this comprehension that makes an empty list for every n in 
        the grid.
        '''
        adj_list = {i: [] for i in range(n)}

        '''
        This DFS works on an adj list heres how it works

        node -> the actual node in the graph
        visited -> the set of the visited nodes so far in the graph
        graph -> the entire adj list
        '''
        def dfs(node, visited, graph):
            visited.add(node) # we add the first node we see to visitied
            for neighbor in graph[node]: # then we get the list of neighbors for that node
                if neighbor not in visited: # iff we find a neighbor we have not already searched
                    dfs(neighbor, visited, graph)    # then we run the DFS again

        '''
        This varies from LC 200 because we cannot utilize the input matrix itself
        to try and mark things we have already visited. 

        So what we need to do is make a visited set that tracks what we have visited
        already so we do not double count anything
        '''

        def bfs(node, visited, graph):
            '''
            for BFS we do the same thing but we just need to 
            work with a visited set as well instead of modifying the grid
            like in 200. Besides that its the same BFS as always. 
            '''
            queue = deque()
            queue.append(node)
            visited.add(node)

            while queue:
                new_node = queue.popleft()

                for neighbor in graph[new_node]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        visited.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append(neighbor)

        # this just initializes the adj_list
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                # this just adds the 1 values we care about and 
                # ensures that we don't add itself (i != j)
                if isConnected[i][j] == 1 and i != j: 
                    adj_list[i].append(j)

        visited = set()
        for city in adj_list: 
            '''
            so every node that we see in the adj_list we should only
            run DFS on the cities we have not visited because we don't
            want to double count anything, once we finish up the DFS
            and we have added all cities we have visitied then we can 
            increment the number of provinces.
            '''
            if city not in visited:
                bfs(city, visited, adj_list)
                provinces += 1
    
        return provinces


```

Notes are contained in here, pretty much the trick is that instead of using BFS or DFS on the adjancency matrix like in 200 we just need to convert the input into a an adjancency list and then used a modified search on that to find if they are connected to each other. Instead of modifying the input grid we just check if we already visited something using a set that we need to manage ourselves.
