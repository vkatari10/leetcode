# BST Iterator

Implement a BST Iterator class

```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class BSTIterator:

    def __init__(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]):

        self.values = []
        self.get_inorder(root, self.values)
        self.index = 0
        self.max = len(self.values)
        

    def next(self) -> int:
        if self.hasNext():
            ans = self.values[self.index]
            self.index += 1
            return ans

    def hasNext(self) -> bool:
        return self.index < self.max

    def get_inorder(self, root, nodes):

        if not root:
            return 

        self.get_inorder(root.left, nodes)
        nodes.append(root.val)
        self.get_inorder(root.right, nodes)
    

        


# Your BSTIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = BSTIterator(root)
# param_1 = obj.next()
# param_2 = obj.hasNext()
```
Time: O(N): Since we do the entire inorder during construction<br>
Space: O(N): Since we need to store all the nodes during the lifetime of the object<br>

Notes: The optimal solution is actually O(1) with O(h) space using a stack, pretty much all you do is do in order in parts where we walk the left most of the list and then every time we get next and pop the node off from the list we just check its right subtree and add any nodes onto the stack before moving up more. This is pretty much just walking the tree in order but instead of doing it all upfront like I did we just use a stack and move when we need to which keeps it O(1) pretty much on average.
