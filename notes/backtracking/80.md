# Combination Sum 

Given an array of numbers find all combinations (repeating numbers allowed) that sum up to the target<br>

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        def dfs(index, combination, total):
            '''
            This is a recursive back tracking solution, similar to subsets (78)
            but with more parameters than before to track the array and total sum
            rather than just the index
            '''

            '''
            These first 2 if statements are obvious base cases

            1. If the total sum of the array matches the target then put
            it onto the answer list and stop

            2. If the total is larger then target sum then just stop, no 
            reaosn to continue
            '''
            if total == target:
                res.append(combination.copy())
                return 
            
            if total > target or index >= len(candidates):
                return 

            '''
            Here is the hard part

            The structure is identical to 78 but has more moving parts

            1. Append the current index number to the list and then recurse
            with adding the total 

            Think about what happens we append the number to the array 
            and recurse once more with the same index
            - We are doing the branch where we include
            - By adding the sum up on subsequent calls if we accidentally
            go over we hit the base case -> return -> go to part 2

            2. Now we pop off to remove the overshot value and try with 
            another number using a diff index
            - We are doing the exclude part of the branch now
            - Why dont we add the total value on the second call?
                - Look at the first set of recursive calls
                - When we call that second recursive call we go back to the first
                one on the subsequent call so the total of the next number of
                index + 1 gets added there NOT at the beginning. 
            
            So pretty much the best way to explain it is
            1. Spam the first number
            2. If we overshoot, remove the last added value and try the next one
            3. Repeat 1. with the new number
            '''
            combination.append(candidates[index])
            dfs(index, combination, total + candidates[index])

            combination.pop()
            dfs(index + 1, combination, total)

            return res

        return dfs(0, [], 0)
```
Time: O(2^n): Backtracking<br>
Space: O(N): To store intermediate results<br>

Notes: This is a more complicated version of 78 since we need to track more values during recursive calls rather than in 78 where we only had to worry about one. The notes explain most of the logic about what is going on
