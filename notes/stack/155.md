# Min Stack 

Implement the Min Stack Data Structure where you can find the min of the stack in O(1) time. 

```Python
class MinStack(object):

    '''
    All this problem is doing is we track both the items 
    we would insert like in a normal stack

    But the idea is that we keep another list in paralell
    that tracks the min value at every push so that we know
    at every pop or top of the stack what the min was
    at each time

    You could also use a single list in the implementation 
    where you push the items as a tuple of val, min but
    the two stack solution also works
    '''

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, val):
        """
        :type val: int
        :rtype: None
        """
        min_val = val if not self.stack else min(val, self.stack[-1][1])
        self.stack.append([val, min_val])
            
        
    def pop(self):
        """
        :rtype: None
        """
        self.stack.pop()
        

    def top(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """
        return self.stack[-1][0]

    def getMin(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """
        return self.stack[-1][1]
        


# Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MinStack()
# obj.push(val)
# obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.getMin()
```
Time: O(1) Since every operation is done in constant time<br>
Space: O(N) Since we need to keep track of items, min values at every push<br>

Notes: This is actaully slower than using two seperate stacks to track the min integers and the actual values but this was done to show you can actually just use one stack if you want.
