# Implement Stack using Queues

Make a stack data structure by using a queue

```Python
from collections import deque

class MyStack:
    '''
    Ok so pretty much everything is the same as it would be usually

    the only diffrence is the push method

    all we are doing is appending the new value to the end and then 
    pushing everying in front of the new value to behind it so 
    that when we pop next time the new value comes out

    so like 
    [] empty
    [a] first item 
    [b, a] second item 
    [c, b, a] third item 

    its literally a reverse stack 
    '''
    def __init__(self):
        self.q = deque()

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.q.append(x)
        for _ in range(len(self.q) - 1):
            self.q.append(self.q.popleft())

    def pop(self) -> int:
        return self.q.popleft()
        

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.q[0]
        
    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.q) == 0
        


# Your MyStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyStack()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
```
Time: O(N) for pushing O(1) for all else<br>
Space: O(N) to store all values in the queue<br>

Notes: Pretty much stack in reverse, you can do it using two queues but this is easier apparently
