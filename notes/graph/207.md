# Course Schedule

Given courses and their prereqs determine if all classes can be taken or not.

```
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        # make an empty adj list for every course
        adj = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}

        '''
        This array pretty much acts as like a frequency array
        
        for every course we can increment how many prereqs (dependencies)
        it has.
        '''
        in_degree = [0] * numCourses

        '''
        The way this works is we need to map it like this:

        course: courses we can take after completing the thing on the LHS

        in other words for every non dependency we need to map what it goes to
        '''
        for dest, src in prerequisites:
            adj[src].append(dest) # add course -> courses unlocked
            in_degree[dest] += 1 # add prereq count

        '''
        Now we perform something that looks like BFS but is really Kahns Algo to 
        help us determine if there are cycles or not in the graph

        What we first do is append all classes that have zero prereqs or no dependencies
        onto the queue
        '''
        queue = deque()
        for i in range(numCourses): # add zero prereq courses
            if in_degree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)

        '''
        while the queue persists we need to perform a BFS like search 

        First remember we added courses that have zero pre-reqs so we pop
        them off the queue and then we need to check for every class we unlock
        from taking this one and then we decrement the freq-array at that position.

        then we need to check that if this point if the freq-array has a value of 0
        then we can prove that it has no more dependencies based on the current classes
        or nodes we have seen so far. 

        We repeat this every time and if we can end up visiting every class once
        then we can prove that all classes can be taken but if something doesn't align
        in the freq-array then we can return false because something cannot be taken
        based on the current classes we have seen.
        '''
        visited = 0
        while queue:
            course = queue.popleft() # pop this course off the queue
            visited += 1
            for neighbor in adj[course]: # for every course unlocked from this course
                in_degree[neighbor] -= 1 # we can show that it fufills whatever course
                if in_degree[neighbor] == 0: # and once that other course has no more prereqs
                    queue.append(neighbor) # we can place it onto the queue

        # if we can visit every single course then true else false
        return visited == numCourses
```
We just use Kahns algorithm which is a topological sort algorithm that determines if cycles exist (which this problem is pretty much asking for), and doing so we can show if the courses do not result in a cycle.<br>

Its still a bit complicated so heres a high level overview of what we did:<br>
- Make an empty hashmap that contains a list for every course
- Make an empty array that contains all zeros that represents how many dependencies we have for each course
- Map every prereq to what it unlocks, or what does taking each course give you access to (This is not intuitive but will make sense later)
- Increment the position of each index in the array, this just shows how many prereqs we have in each course where each index represents (This is just a hashmap as an array or aka a frequency array)
- Make a deque and add everything that has a 0 in the freq-array onto the queue
- While the queue persists we will popleft and increased the amount of courses we visited, then for every course that this course we just popped unlocks we just decrease the amount of prereqs for that in the freq array (Think of popping as taking the course and unlocking those courses, allowing us to decrease the amount of courses we took)
- Once the position in the freq-array becomes 0 we can put it onto the array and then check what else it unlocks.
- If we could visit every class that was originally given then we can show we can take every class, else false
