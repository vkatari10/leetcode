# Binary Tree Right Side View

Pretend you are looking at a Binary Tree from the RHS give all the nodes you would be able to see<br>

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []
        
        # intialize queue
        q = deque()
        ans = []
        q.append(root)

        '''
        We will use an BFS implementation in this problem
        since all we want to do is grab the rightmost node
        at every level
        '''
        while q:

            # the length of the queue is how many nodes we have at this level
            level_size = len(q) 

            # now for every node at this level we want to add the other left and right
            # nodes as BFS is usually implemented 
            for i in range(level_size):
                
                # but instead we pop off the queue repeatedly instead of once
                # since this in the for loop
                node = q.popleft() 
               
               
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)

                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)

                # the logic here is that once i reaches the end
                # this must be the right most node of this level
                # so we append it to the answer array
                if i == level_size - 1:
                    ans.append(node.val)


        '''
        Compare this to LC 102 they are very similar in nature with slight modifications
        '''
        return ans
```

Note: To see a similar solution see Leetcode 102, but really this is just BFS with some extra steps.
