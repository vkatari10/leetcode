# Surrounded Regions

Given a board of 'X' and 'O's find any 'O' on the edge and make any other 'O's that it touches 'O' else make every other 'O' that does not touch an edge 'O' into an 'X'

class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        
        '''
        Intuition:

        The goal in this problem is to replace any 'O's in the board
        that have no direct connection to the edge of the board with 'X'

        If the 'O' has some direction up down right or left that connects
        with the board then we need to ensure that stays 'O'

        Implementaion:

        Look for 'O's in the board on the edge, then use DFS or BFS to check
        for other adjancent 'O's we can use a placeholder variable liek F to 
        ensure we dont double count anything then go over the grid again and
        replace the temps with 'O'
