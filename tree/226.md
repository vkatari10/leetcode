# Invert Binary Tree

Invert the values of a binary tree

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:

        if not root: # base case
            return root
        
        root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left # swap both right and left children

        self.invertTree(root.left) # now do the same for both children
        self.invertTree(root.right)
        return root

        # does not matter if they are None/null in this case since they will be 
        # handled by the base case anyways
```
Time: O(N) Since we need to visit every node<br>
Space: O(1) Since we use recursion the space we use is implied rather than us explicitly defining the stack<br>

Notes: This is pretty simple since we use recursion but if we wanted to use a explicit stack or anything or use BFS or DFS then it becomes more compliacted
