# Kth smallest element in a BST

Find the Kth smallest element given a BST

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        result = None

        def inorder(root):
            '''
            here we use a nonlocal variable so we can allow these variables
            persist even after the recursive calls, if we do not use these then 
            they will be reset of every new call on the stack and will not be propogated
            back up
            '''
            nonlocal k, result

            '''
            This is the base case

            if the root is null or we find our result we should return
            '''
            if not root or result is not None:
                return
               
            inorder(root.left) # we traverse in-order since that gives us results sorted

            k -= 1 # decrement the value of K
            if k == 0:
                result = root.val # once we hit 0 we know that this K is the answer return 
                return
            
            inorder(root.right) # also part of basic in order traversal
                
        
        inorder(root)
        return result
        
```

Notes: This above is the optimal solution using recursion however in interviews we cold be asked to implement it with a stack. In that case we want to use a iterative approach where we mimic recursion by adding all possible left values first, popping off the stack, decrementing K, and then exploring the right subtree. The code would look like the one below.

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        current = root
        stack = []

        '''
        While the the stack persists or the current node points to something that is not None
        '''
        while stack or current:

            '''
            Just like the recursive solution we need to keep checking the LHS of the tree

            add them onto the stack and move left while we can 
            '''
            while current:
                stack.append(current)
                current = current.left

            '''
            Take a look of the last thing on the stack, and pop it off
            '''
            current = stack.pop()
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return current.val

            '''
            Similar to the recursive in order solution we need to then move right after
            we have exhausted the left side, and remember we keep doing this for as long
            as current is not None 
            '''
            current = current.right
```
