# Group Anagrams

Given a list of strings group all the anagrams together

## First Attempt

```
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:

        # store the letters within itselfs

        seen = set()

        copy = []

        for i in range(len(strs)): # make a copy list with the sorted words
            copy.append("".join(sorted(strs[i])))
            seen.add(copy[i])

        hash_map = {i: [] for i in seen} # create empty hashmap with every word

        for i in range(len(strs)): # put the indexes of the original strings that match into the hash map
            hash_map[copy[i]].append(i)

        words = [k for k in hash_map] # create list of all the sorted words

       

        ans = []
        for word in words:
            this_list = []
            for j in hash_map[word]: # for every word in the hash_map
                this_list.append(strs[j]) # we just add that to this list 

            ans.append(this_list) # and append to answer

        return ans

       
```
Time: O(n^2) Since we need to look at every word and every index at the last step<br>
Space: O(n) Since we need to store every intermediate word we find in a set, hash_map, and another array<br>

## Optimal Solution

The optimal solution is literally my logic but cleaned up to look nice<br>
```
from collections import defaultdict # dont forget meee

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        
        hash_map = defaultdict(list) # make a hash_map with list as values already there

        for s in strs: # for every string in the input
            key = "".join(sorted(s)) # again sort the string here as the key 
            hash_map[key].append(s) # just append the original string at the key value

        return list(hash_map.values()) # take the values of the hash_map and make it into a list
```
Time: O(n * k log k v) Since we need to sort every string and also traverse the entire input list<br>
Space: O(n) We need to store every string in the hash_map<br>

Notes: This is a pretty easy problem once we understand we need to sort the input I think the code is pretty self explanatory once you come to that reealization.
