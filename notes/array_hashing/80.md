# Remove duplicates from sorted array II

Modify a sorted array in place so that all elements appear st most twice<br>

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        '''
        Two pointer solution --

        Pretty much we can skip the first two elements since they will always satisfy the 
        conditions of this problem 

        All we need to do is then bubble up all the right answers by checking if the 
        previous two answers do not equal the current if they dont then we can bring 
        the rightmost element to the left

        '''
        left = 2

        for right in range(2, len(nums)): # start at 2
            if nums[right] != nums[left - 2]: # only if the last two element are the same or unique
                nums[left] = nums[right] # move up the new item 
                left += 1

        return left


        
```
Time: O(N) Since we need to check every element in the input array<br>
Space: O(1) Two Pointers<br>

Notes: This is a very similar problem to other two pointer questions but its clever in checking the last two elements rather than using another data structure to track frequency of items.
