# Sliding Window Max

For window size k in an array find the max Value

```Python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        '''Monotonic deque sliding window'''
        q = deque() # this will store indicies not the actual numbers
        ans = []

        for index, number in enumerate(nums): # enumerate for indexes as well 
            
            while q and nums[q[-1]] <= number:
                '''
                Pretty much pop off all the values from the right
                if the last numbers in the queue are less than the current 
                number
                '''
                q.pop()
            
            q.append(index) # now put this new index on the end of the deque

            if q[0] == index - k: # if element outside of the window
                '''
                If the element happens to be outside this current window
                then we need to pop it off from the left side
                '''
                q.popleft()

            if index >= k - 1:
                '''
                All this conditions is saying is that once the index passes the 
                size of the window then we can start appending numbers to the 
                final answer
                '''
                ans.append(nums[q[0]])

            '''
            Pretty much these 3 steps are doing this 

            1. Taking this new number if the last element in the deque is smaller 
            then just pop those numbers from the deque

            2. Now if the first index in the deque is outside this window go ahead and 
            remove it 

            3. Now q[0] holds the index to the max value so we can just append it to 
            answer iff the idnex is past the value of k (the window large enough to 
            get a max) or you can think of it as the window being full 
            '''

        return ans
```
Time: O(N) since we need to check every value in the array<br>
Space: O(N) since we need a deque to store values in<br>

Notes: This is just a monotonic deque sliding window solution, if we wanted to min value for each item then we would just need to flip the comparison statement in the first if statement
