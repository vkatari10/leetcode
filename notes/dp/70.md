# Climbing Stairs

It takes n steps to climb to the top how many distinct ways are there to reach the top if we can only move up 1 or 2 steps up at a time.


O(N) Space Tabular DP<br>
```
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:

        if n <= 3: # base case
            return n

        dp = [0] * (n) # dp array 
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 2

        for i in range(2, n): # from base case all the way to N we compute the next iterations
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]

        return dp[n - 1]
```

O(1) Space Tabular DP<br>
```
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 3: # base case
            return n

        a, b = 1, 2 # these are the base cases that we can build up from 

        for _ in range(3, n + 1): # from the base case to n + 1
            a, b = b, a + b  # swap the value of a to be the old value
            # make b = a + b so we can get the next result

        return b
```

Time: O(N) We need to compute up to N to figure out the amount of distinct ways<br>
Space: O(N) / O(1) depending if we use an array or variables<br>

Notes: This is just fibonacci numbers again but the sequence is off by one so its a very easy DP problem. We could first easily construct the O(N) space solution since it is more intuitive, but the O(1) space solution is also easy to do since the entire DP construction depends on two variables. I have both listed
