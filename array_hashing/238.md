# Product of Array Except Self

In O(n) time find the product of the array without the index of its own value without using the division operator.

```
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        n = len(nums)
        ans = [1] * n 

        '''
        To solve this in O(n) time we need to do a prefix and suffix pass
        on the array of nums

        This means we will lag the multiplcation by one index so that we never
        include this index when calculating the multiplication

        This is essentially a prefix and suffix product
        '''
        prefix = 1 # set base for multiplication
        for i in range(n):
            '''
            This loop will multiply each value in the array with all values 
            on the left excluding itself

            Then after set the prefix in the ans arr we need to multiply the prefix
            value by itself which updates its value with THIS index
            '''
            ans[i] = prefix 
            prefix *= nums[i]


        suffix = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            '''
            Now we will do the same thing but traverse the array from the back 
            to the front, this will now calculate the product of all items on the
            right of every index excluding itself
            '''
            ans[i] *= suffix
            suffix *= nums[i]

        return ans

```
Time: O(N) Since we need to traverse the array twice<br>
Space: O(1)/O(N) Leetcode did not consider the answer array extra space but it technically is so O(N)<br>

Notes: This a prefix/suffix type solution which is common when we need to something x times without y or the sort.
