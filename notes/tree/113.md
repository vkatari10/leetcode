# Path Sum II

Given the root of a binary tree find a sum from root to leaf node that is equivalent to the sum of some target sum.<br>

Solution:
```
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> List[List[int]]:

        ans = []
        curr = []
        
        def DFS(root):
            if not root:
                return 

            # preorder DFS doesnt matter if we did postorder
            curr.append(root.val) # add to current root
            DFS(root.left) # regular preorder ordering
            DFS(root.right)
            
            # once we hit the root node of a tree check if the current path 
            # matches the target sum
            if sum(curr) == targetSum:
                ans.append(list(curr)) # we want the static version of the list
            
            # after we determine wheter or not it is a sum we can just pop off the last
            # value from the stack since we know that this is a leaf node and cannot go any
            # further based on the if statemente executing
            curr.pop()

        DFS(root)
        return ans


        
```
Notes: We use a generic DFS search here and we can apply this to other DFS related problems when needing to use similar related things on trees.
