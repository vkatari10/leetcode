# Two Sum 

Find two numbers in the array that add up to a target and return the indicies. 

```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        hash_map = {}

        for i, num in enumerate(nums): # we need both the index and value for the hash_map
       
            if target - num in hash_map: # if target - num (complement) in hash_map

                # i is just this number so we can return it as well
                return [i, hash_map[target-num]] # return the index contained at target-num
            

            # else we add the number to the hash_map and check again in the next iteration
            hash_map[num] = i
```
Time: O(N) Worst case the two numbers are at the end of the array<br>
Space: O(N) Worst case we store every index except the last<br>

Notes: We can use a hash map and exploit the nature of the problem to do this pretty quickly
