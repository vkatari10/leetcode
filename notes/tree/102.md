# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Return a list of lists where each list is the nodes at that level in a tree.

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []

        # See 199 for a similar implementation and more in-depth solution

        ans = []

        q = deque()
        q.append(root)

        while q:
            level_len = len(q) # grab the legnth of the queue at this level 
            level_nodes = [] # this will put all the nodes at this level
            for i in range(level_len): # this just interates over each node at this level
                
                new_node = q.popleft()

                if new_node.left:
                    q.append(new_node.left)
                
                if new_node.right:
                    q.append(new_node.right)

                level_nodes.append(new_node.val)
            
            ans.append(level_nodes)

        return ans
```

Note: Look at 199.md for a more indepth explanation of what we did here, but simply this is obviously a BFS like problem that has some extra quirks
