# Longest Subtring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        # This uses a sliding window problem 
        
        seen = set()
        left = 0 # this will be the first pointer
        max_len = 0

        for right in range(len(s)): 
            while s[right] in seen: # if we find that the char is already visited
                seen.remove(s[left]) # remove it from the set
                left += 1 # and bring the left pointer up (right)
            seen.add(s[right]) # now add all the new chars back onto the set
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1) # update max length 

        return max_len
```
Time: O(N) Since we need to check every character once<br>
Space: O(N) Since we need to store the characters we have seen<br>
Notes: This is the most basic sliding window problem, also using two pointers (left and right) and can be applied to other similar problems where applicable.
