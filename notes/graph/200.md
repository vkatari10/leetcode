# Number of Islands

Given a 2D array of '1's and '0's find the number of islands where an island is any number of '1's surrounded by other ones left, right, up, or down.

            '''
            Here we check if i or j is out of bounds to ensure that we stay within the 
            provided grid

            The check for grid[i][j] = '0' is to make sure that when we run the dfs
            and we keep moving in a certain direction if we ever encounter a zero this means
            that beyond this point there is no more '1's to be found so we just need to return.

            If we were to exclude this then this would lead to stack overflow because 
            we would keep searching for '0's
            '''

                '''
                In the nature of DFS we use recursion because the stack that we could
                implement interativley is implied. In this case we just check every
                direction the problemn wants from us (up, down, right, left) and call
                it again

                We also mark the grid at this point as zero because we don't want to double 
                count a '1'. Think about if we moved to the left and then moved back right and
                still saw a one then we would check off the same '1' twice, so we make it to 
                a '0' to indicate that this position in the grid has been visited.

Note: This is the solution that can be implemented using DFS and BFS on a 2D Matrix
