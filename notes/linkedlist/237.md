# Delete Node From linked list

Given a singly linked list delete a node from it in place, where you are given a random node from the list (not the head) and you will not be given the tail node as the random node.

```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        '''
        We are deleting the next node from the given node

        Pretty much all we are doing is stealing the value from the next node
    
        And then we set its next to the next node after the next node (next.next)

        This implicitly deletes the node after the given node from the problem 
        meaning that we can delete this node inplace 

        Technically mem leak tho we just threw out a node
        '''
        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = node.next.next

```
Time: O(1) Since we are just rearranging pointers<br>
Space: O(1) Just two pounters nodes<br>

Notes: Seems impossible at first but very sneaky solution, easy once you understand we are just stealing another nodes value and then killing it implicitly.
