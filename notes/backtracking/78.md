# Subsets

Create the power set given a list of numbers

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        '''
        This is canonical backtracking in this problem 
        '''
        res = []
        subset = []     

        def dfs(i):
            '''
            This is the backtracking solution here pretty much what happens is

            1. Base

            If we are at an i value where it is greater than the number of items in the lsit
            then we need to return but we also know that this subset is done for so we can 
            just append it to answer

            2. Include nums[i]

            We will then branch from when we include nums[i] and this gives us one decision
            we could have made

            3. Exclude nums[i]

            Then we pop off the list to exclude nums[i] and this give us the other decision 
            we could have made 

            Eventually after recursing enough we hit the base case and then we are forced
            to append this subset back the answer result
            '''
            if i >= len(nums): 
                res.append(subset[:])
                return
            
            subset.append(nums[i])
            dfs(i + 1)

            subset.pop()
            dfs(i + 1)

        dfs(0) # 0 as in 0th index not the number 0 
        return res
```
Time: O(2^n) Since we need to check every possible branch for every number in the list<br>
Space: O(N) Since we need to store the intermediate results into the final answer<br>

Notes: This is canonical backtracking I think the comments explain the gist of what's going on but the actual recursion idk, trust the recursion for these problems.
