# Maximum Subarray 

Given an array with positive and negative values find the maximum subarray and reuturn the sum value.

```Python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        

        '''
        This is just iterative Kandanes

        The way it works is we set the final result to be nums[0]
        in the case that its the only value or the max value alone
        in the array
        '''
        result = nums[0]
        total = 0

        for num in nums:
            '''
            Then for every number in the array we add onto a total, but if said 
            total becomes negative at any point then we need to reset the total 
            back down to 0 

            This is because if the subarray goes negative then the next future sub
            array will also become negative
            '''
            if total < 0:
                total = 0

            total += num

            result = max(result, total)

        return result
```
Time: O(N) Since we need to check every item in the array<br>
Space: O(1) Since we just need to add every number up<br>

Notes: Kandane Algo
