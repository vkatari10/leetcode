# Top K frequent elements

Return the most K frequent elements in a list 

```
import heapq

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        
        heap = [] # we will use this later
        hash_map = {}   # count the freq of each number in the input array

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            hash_map[nums[i]] = hash_map.get(nums[i], 0) + 1

        '''
        Now we will set up a priority queue and push everything from the input 
        array onto the pq

        Since heaps in deafult are min heaps we need to insert all the values
        as negative to achieve max heap instead since we want to get the highest
        freq values in this problem
        '''
        for key, val in hash_map.items():
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-val, key)) # we use the heap here

        res = []
        '''
        Since we stored the highest freq values at the front of the pq then we can just
        pop off the heap until we get the value of before and then return res which
        gives the answer that we want
        '''
        while len(res) < k:
            res.append(heapq.heappop(heap)[1])

        return res

        
        
```
Time: O(n log k) Since we need to over the entire input list and push everything onto the priority queue which is (log k)<br>
Space: O(n) SInce we need to store values in the hash_map and the priority queue<br>

Notes: This problem involves a trick of just making the default min heaps into max heaps so when we make the result we take the highest level values
