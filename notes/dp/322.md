# Coin Change

Find the minum number of coins to make some given amount 

```

    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:

        '''
        This is a bottom up tabular apporach the the problem we could also 
        do top bottom where we use a memo and recursion to check each subproblem
        but it is considerably slower than this approach
        '''

        dp = [0] * (amount + 1)

        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            minimum = float('inf') # set the min value to infinity for now

            '''
            This is very much a brute force solution but we need to check every coin

            For every coin we will find the reamining value left from this subtracting 
            this value of the current amount and we can check the difference
            '''
            for c in coins:
                diff = i - c

                '''
                This is the most complex part, here we need to show two things

                1. if the diffence of this amount is greater than the value - 
                the coin value is less than zero
                then we cannot make valid change out of this coin, therefore we need to skip

                2. If we can make a valid difference from this coin (i.e.  > 0) then 
                we need to show how much more coins we need to make up for the current 
                difference

                Think of diff being the remainder of the how much more value
                we need to make where the index of diff in the dp array stores the value
                of the number of coins we need to make
                '''
                if diff < 0:
                    continue
                
                '''
                Now we can set the min value to the value of the coins needed to make
                up for the difference

                Why +1? Because it took one more coin to get here so we need to take that into 
                account that we just added another coin onto the difference since we already
                took dp[diff] steps to get here +  1
                '''
                minimum = min(minimum, dp[diff] + 1)

            # set the index of the dp array to this new minimum
            dp[i] = minimum


        if dp[amount] < float('inf'):
            return dp[amount]
        else:
            return -1
```
Time: O(a * c) Need to check every amount and every coin<br>
Space: O(a) Need to store the coins needed for every amount<br>

Notes: This could also be solved using a top bottom dp approach but the tabular approach for this problem is far faster. This is a considerably hard DP problem but I tried my best to break it down in the code above but it really helps to watch people break it down.
