# Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Given a binary tree turn it into a linked list so that every right node acts at the next pointer and every left node is null.

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        
        nodes = []

        def preorder(root):
            if not root:
                return 

            nodes.append(root)
            preorder(root.left)
            preorder(root.right)

        preorder(root)

        temp = root

        for i in range(1, len(nodes)):
            temp.right = nodes[i]
            temp.left = None
            temp = nodes[i]

```

Time: O(n) To perform preorder traversal<br>
Space: O(n) To store intermediate nodes<br>

Notes: This is a pretty simpe solution, similar to 98 in some ways that we just need to store the nodes and just readjust pointers. All we need to do is make the left pointers None and make the right pointer the next node in the list. Note that in the list we are storing the node reference itself not just the value.
