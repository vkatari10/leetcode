# Reverse Linked List

Given a singly linked list, reverse it and return the new head

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        newHead = None # set the newHead to be None intially

        while head:
            temp = head.next # save next pointer from head
            head.next = newHead # point to the backward nodes
            newHead = head # now set newHead to be the last node added
            head = temp   # adjust head back to the next node
        return newHead
```
Time: O(n) Since we need to visit every node <br>
Space: O(1) Since we just do pointer manipulation<br>

Notes: We could just make a list and then copy it in reverse but this takes too much time and this is far faster.
