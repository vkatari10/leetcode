# Reorder list

Reorder a linked list in place to the nodes are in the order of 0 -> n -> 1 -> n - 1 -> ...<br>

Time: O(N) either way since we need to traverse the entire linked list<br>

Notes: My solution just wires the node together by working from left to right and adjusting the "pointers" where as the ChatGPT solution will break the list in half, reverse the second half, and then merge the two lists together. The GPT solution is more inuitive but harder to implement on the spot but it breaks it down into 3 easy steps so its not that once u understand the trick.
