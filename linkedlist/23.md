# Merge K sorted Lists

Given a list of linked lists where each linked list is sorted combine them into one sorted linked list.

```
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        heap = []
        '''
        Instead of putting every single node onto the list the goal is to minimize the
        size of the heap by just taking the head of every linked list in the given 
        input

        This reduces the size of the heap from NlogN -> NlogK where K is the number 
        of linked list int the list input
        '''
        for idx, node in enumerate(lists):
            if node:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (node.val, idx, node))

        dummy = ListNode() # make dummy node
        temp = dummy

        while heap: # while we still have nodes on the heap 
            val, idx, node = heapq.heappop(heap) # get the min val node from the list
            temp.next = node # append to the result list
            temp = temp.next

            '''
            Here is the other optimization part, since we never actually put the node
            in the enumeration before starting this loop we need to put those nodes
            on the heap at this point so when the next iteration begins if we need 
            to insert those nodes then we can just grab them then, this is what keeps
            the heap small at all times by only pushing things we need at once. 

            This is possible since every input linked loist in lists was already sorted
            so we know the min values that need to be put on the final list would have
            already been put on by this point so we can just push them onto the heap now
            '''
            if node.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, idx, node.next))

        return dummy.next


```
Time: O(Nlogk) Since we need to account for every node, but keep the heap at logk length at all times<br>
Space: O(K) Since we need to at most keep K nodes on the list.<br>

Notes: This problem could be solved by putting every single node on the heap at once but the provided solution above is the most optimal since by keeping the heap at a minimum size allows for popping time to be minimized.
